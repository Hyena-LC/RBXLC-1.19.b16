RBXLegacy is a multi-version ROBLOX client, built to allow the user to run LAN and Internet servers.

--------------------------------
========= INSTRUCTIONS =========
--------------------------------

WARNING: 
If Hamachi is on, you won't be able to join "localhost" or any other local or private IP address! In order to use RBXLegacy on LAN or Play Solo, 
you must either turn off Hamachi by pressing the "Turn Off" button, or by turning one of your Hamachi networks online if you own a network.


NOTE:
Make sure the server you are trying to join is in your region of the world (I.E West US, East US, UK, etc), if it is not you may experience major network lag issues.
(i.e. if you are in Arizona and someone hosts a server in Florida, you will not have a fun time because it will lag a lot.)
If you have a problem where you can't see your character, REGENERATE YOUR PLAYER ID THEN REJOIN THE SERVER.
If you tried to connect to the server and you get an error, REJOIN THE SERVER.
